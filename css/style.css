style.css

Custom CSS specific for EC Mapeditor module.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SCOPE:
  In some cases (like in Digital Single Market) it's necessary to hide the default link to entity node page.
  When this append, usually with the CSS rule:
  .entity-map h2 { display: none; }
  it's necessary to assure the tags H2 within the map (PopIn and PopUp windows) are not affected by the previous
  'too generic' rule.
*/

/* Overrides previous rule to show H2 tags within map PopUp and PopIn windows. */
.entity-map .content h2 {
    display: block;
}
